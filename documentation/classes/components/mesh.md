## Mesh

**Extends [TraceableObject](traceableObject.md)**

Simple 2D mesh class for use with mesh-based components.

### Parameters

-   `path` **[Array][1]&lt;[Vector](../vector.md)>** The vertices from which the mesh is
    created. The first point should not be repeated at the end.
-   `handles` **([number][2] \| [Array][1]&lt;[number][2]>)** The handle or handles which this
    component should apply to. Defaults to neither (default defined
    in [Component](component.md)). It is recommended to leave this value set to neither,
    as the mesh itself doesn't have any behaviour anyway. (optional, default `[]`)

### trace

Traces the shape of the mesh.

#### Parameters

-   `index` **[number][2]** Index of the handle to trace the shape. (optional, default `1`)

Returns **[Promise][3]** The promise that runs the trace script.
